Thanks to the whole OpenFrameworks community.

Use watershedApp to generate new Watershed files. (Limited to 5 images)

Use breakingPointsApp to see the original installation. (Use imagery from Watershed App, no Audio)
This has bugs to do with image loading over a long period.

Use breakingPointsIIApp to see the second installation. (Use imagery from Watershed App, no Audio)
This corrects the bugs in the original version.
